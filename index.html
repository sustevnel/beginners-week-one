<p>I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

<h3>HTML is cool</h3>
<h4>CSS is cooler</h4>
<h5>JS is the best</h5>

<h2>What fo you need to do to create a website</h2>

<h3>Not much!</h3>
<<p>Acomputer (always a good start)</p>
<p>A text editor (I am using atom)</P>
<p>A web browser (I am using chrome)</p>
<p>Some HTML, CSS and JS files<p/>
